# FreePIE-scripts

A collection of my personal [FreePIE](https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE) scripts.  
I don't work with Python much so you can expect some janky code.

### `midi_to_vJoy`
This script is for converting the damper pedal MIDI input into a vJoy output. I made it to experiment with using the damper pedal as a gas pedal in Euro Truck Simulator 2.

In my testing, it worked, but only reported on/off (0 or 127) values. Not too useful...
